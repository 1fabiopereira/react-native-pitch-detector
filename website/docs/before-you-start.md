# Before you start

React Native Picth Detector is a module, created to be used alongside [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), so previous experience is required. If you need, can start with their [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial and come back here after.

Currently, this module is only compatible for Android devices, we assume that you have all Android environment configured, in the case that you don't have, we suggest that you setup the enviroment before.
