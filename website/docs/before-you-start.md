# Before you start

React Native Picth Detector is a module created to be used alongside [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), so previous experience is required. If you need, can start with their [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial and come back here after.

This module is compatible with Android and iOS devices, we assume that you have Android and iOS environment configured, in the case that you don't have, we suggest that you setup enviroment before.

For android devices we use a [TarsosDSP](https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP) library to perform a pitch estimation and for iOS devices we use [Beethoven](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/Beethoven) library, you can see more about these on yours respectives documentations.

If you see something wrong, feel free to report an issue on [Github](https://github.com/1fabiopereira/react-native-pitch-detector), pull requests are encouraged. Know more about it on [Contributing](https://1fabiopereira.github.io/react-native-pitch-detector/docs/contributing) session.
