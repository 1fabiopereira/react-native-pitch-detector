> :bulb: It is important to note that you need to use a real device to test the audio input.

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.

To start the packager:

```shell
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```shell
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```shell
yarn example ios
```
